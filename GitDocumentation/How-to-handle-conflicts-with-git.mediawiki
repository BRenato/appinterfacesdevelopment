How to handle conflicts when merging something with git :

When you have a fork and you want update it because you have conflicts, it's good to know how to do it.

Don't forget to add the remote upstream before doing the following steps.

You have done a :

<pre>$ git fetch upstream</pre>

and then a :

<pre>$ git merge upstream/master</pre>

But it has failed :

<pre>error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:
        build/build.number
Please, commit your changes or stash them before you can merge.
Aborting</pre>

You have changed something in the file build/build.number, so you have two choices revert you change or if you want lose your change stash it.

In my case i do a simple revert :

<pre>$ git reset --hard HEAD</pre>

Now it's good :

<pre>HEAD is now at 030223c # [#21] Little issue with parent on agora category import</pre>

You can do the merge :


<pre>$ git merge upstream/master</pre>

But now you have a conflict :

<pre>Auto-merging administrator/components/com_kunenaimporter/CHANGELOG.php
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in administrator/components/com_kunenaimporte
r/CHANGELOG.php
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.</pre>

Check the differences :

<pre>$ git diff</pre>

<pre>diff --cc administrator/components/com_kunenaimporter/CHANGELOG.php
index e98aba5,9d74f73..0000000

Go into eclipse/Zend Studio and edit the file to remove the conlfict.  Then, when you have done you need to mark the conflicts as resolved :

<pre>$ git add -u</pre>

You can check that all is fine before commit :

<pre>$ git status</pre>

No conflicts anymore. So, you can commit :

<pre>$ git commit -m "# [#74] Fix a very bad bug"</pre>

You need to do now a push on the origin
